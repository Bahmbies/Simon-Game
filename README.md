I used HTML, CSS, Javacript for my browser based game
<h1> Try the game out here! </h1>

<p> If time was allotted to add more details in my project. I would add a sountrack for the click event and a background overall music for the webpage. Also I would've liked to add a Score Counter & a replay game mode button.</p>
